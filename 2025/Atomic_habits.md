# Atomic Habits - James Clear

Captar 1 The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
- Habits are the compound interest of selfimprovement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts of a lot in a long-run. 
- Habits are a **double-edged sword**, they can work for you or against you, which why understanding the details is essential.
- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a **critical threshold**. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.
- An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of **molecules**, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.
- If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Captar 2 How you habits shape your identity
- There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.
- The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
- Your identity **emerges** out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results(although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

Chapter 3 How to build better habit in 4 simple steps
- A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to became automatic.
- The **ultimate** purpose of a habit is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.
- Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: **cue**, **craving**, response, and reward.
- The four laws of behavior change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are: a. make it obvios, b. make it attractive, c. make it easy, d. make it satisfying.

Chapter 4 The man who didn't look right
- With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without **consciously** thinking about it.
- Once our habits became automatic, we stop playing attention to what we are doing.
- The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
- Pointing-and-calling raises your level of awareness from a **nonconscious** habit to a more conscious level by **verbalizing** your actions.
- The habits **scorecard** is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.

Chapter 5 The best way to start a new habit.
- The 1st law of behavior change is make it obvious.
- The two most common cues are time and location.
- Creating an **implementation intention** is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.
- The implementation intention formula is : I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]
- **Habit stacking** is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.
- The habit stacking formula is : After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].

Chapter 6 Motivation is overrated, environment often matters more
- Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.
- Every habit is **initiated** by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
- Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
- **Gradually**, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.
- It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.

Chapter 7 The secret to self-control
- The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is **make it invisible**.
- Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.
- People with high self-control tend to spend less time to tempting situations. Its easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce **exposure** to the cue that cause it.
- Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.

Chapter 8 How to make a habit **irresistible**
- The 2nd law of behavior change is **make it attractive**.
- The more attractive opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.
- Habits are **dopamine-driven** feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.
- It is the **anticipation** of a reward, not the fulfillment of it. That gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine **spike**.
- Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.

Chapter 9 The role of Family and Friends Shaping Your Habits
- The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.
- We tend to adopt habits that are **praised** and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the **tribe**.
- We tend to imitate the habit of three social groups: the close(family and friend), the many(the tribe), and the powerful(those with status and **prestige**)
- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2)you already have something in common with the group.
- The normal behavior of the tribe often overpower the desired behavior of **individual**. Most days, we would rather be wrong with the **crowd** than be right by ourselves.
- If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and **praise**, we find it attractive.

Chapter 10 How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits
- The **inversion** of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is **make it unattractive**.
- Every behavior has a **surface** level craving and a deeper **underlying motive**.
- Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.
- The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that **precedes** them.
- Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.
- Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation **ritual** by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.
- Life feels **reactive**, but it is actually **predictive**.

Chapter 11 Walk Slowly, but Never **Backward**
- The 3rd Law of behavior change is **make it easy**.
- The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.
- Focus on taking action, not being motion.
- Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.
- The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.

Chapter 12 The Law of Least Effort
- Human behavior follows the Law of **Least Effort**. We will naturally **gravitate** toward the option that requires the least of work.
- Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.
- Reduce the **friction** associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.
- Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult. 
- Prime your environment to make future actions easier.

Chapter 13 How to stop **procrastinate** by using the Two-Minute rules
- Make it easy to start, the rest will follow.
- Habit can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.
- Many habits occur at **decisive moments** - choices that are like a fork in the road - and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.
- The **Two-Minute Rule** states, "When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do."
- The more you **ritualize** the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can **slip into** the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.
- **Standardize** before you optimize. You can not improve a habits that does not exist.

Chapter 14 How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible
- The inversion of the 3rd Law of behavior change is **make it difficult**.
- A **commitment device** is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.
- The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits.
- **Onetime choices** - like buying a better **mattress** of enrolling in an automatic saving plan - are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.
- Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to **guarantee** the right behavior.

Chapter 15 The **Cardinal Rule** of behavior change
- Change is easy when it is enjoyable.
- The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.
- We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.
- The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.
- The Cardinal RUle of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated, what is immediately punished is avoided.
- To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful, even if its in a small way.
- The first three laws of behavior change, make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy. Increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change-make it satisfying-increase the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.

Chapter 16 How to stick with good habits every day
- One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.
- A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit, like marking an X on a calender.
- Habit tracker and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.
- Do not break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.
- Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.
- Just because you can measure something does not mean it is the most important thing.
