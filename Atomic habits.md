# Atomic Habits - James Clear
Captar 1 The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
- Habits are the compound interest of selfimprovement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts of a lot in a long-run. 
- Habits are a **double-edged sword**, They can work for you or against you, which why understanding the details is essential.
- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a **critical threshold**. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.
- An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.
- If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Captar 2 How you habits shape your identity
- There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.
- The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
- Your identity **emerges** out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results(although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

Chapter 3 How to build better habit in 4 simple steps
- A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to became automatic.
- The **ultimate** purpose of a habit is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.
- Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: **cue**, **craving**, response, and reward.
- The four laws of behavior change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are: a. make it obvios, b. make it attractive, c. make it easy, d. make it satisfying.

Chapter 4 The man who didn't look right
- With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.
- Once our habits became automatic, we stop playing attention to what we are doing.
- The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
- Pointing-and-calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by **verbalizing** your actions.
- The habits scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.

Chapter 5 The best way to start a new habit.
- The 1st law of behavior change is make it obvious.
- The two most common cues are time and location.
- Creating an **implementation intention** is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.
- The implementation intention formula is : I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]
- **Habit stacking** is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.
- The habit stacking formula is : After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].

Chapter 6 Motivation is overrated, Environment often matters more
- Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.
- Every habit is **initiated** by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
- Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
- **Gradually**, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.
- It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.

Chapter 7 The secret to self-control
- THe inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible.
- Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.
- People with high self-control tend to spend less time to tempting situations. Its easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that cause it.
- Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.
